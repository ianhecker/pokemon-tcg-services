# Test

See [MOCKS.md](./MOCKS.md) for mocks and mock generation

## Testing

Running tests - *includes automatic mock generation*
```bash
make test
```

### Mocks

Mocks are autogenerated for every interface and updated on changes to functions

Do not manually edit mock files - just run `mockery`
```golang
// Code generated by mockery; DO NOT EDIT.
// github.com/vektra/mockery
```

> You will need to delete mocks for interfaces that have been renamed or removed

### Testing Coverage

To see testing coverage percentages for each package
```bash
make coverage
```

To view coverages in-browser
```bash
make view-coverage
```
