## Overview

The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) released its first set in the US in 1998.

Any card collector will have to evaluate the values of cards at some point.

### Pricing Standards

[TCG Player](https://www.tcgplayer.com/) marketplace is the gold standard
for card pricing.

Both collectors and businesses use it to look up comparable listings, or “comps”,
to estimate a card’s value by its condition.

### The Mint Condition Problem

Mainstream collecting heavily focuses on *Mint* and *Near Mint* conditions.

Existing pricing tools are defaulted for *Mint* or *Near Mint* conditions.

### Used Card Comps

A large part of the trading card market are used cards below *Mint* Condition.

Conditions:
- Mint - **M**
- Near Mint - **NM**
- Lightly Played - **LP**
- Moderately Played - **MP**
- Heavily Played - **HP**
- Damaged - **D**

Used cards are often not clearly graded, or can have their condition haggled.

Estimating card value then means checking comps for multiple conditions.

### Comps Across Conditions

Some tools can check lower condition comps, but only one specific condition at a
time.

Checking comps for multiple conditions requires repeated searches and scrolling
with visual parsing.

No price history remains leftover, but your memory.

Check across multiple cards, in a busy card show, with slow mobile data?
Good luck checking comps!

### Project Goal

This project aims to make comps simpler.

It removes the need to for multiple searches and scrolling endlessly in the TCG
Player app.

For a card, it shows recent sales for all conditions in one compact view.

Prices are up-to-date and derived from aggregated data across multiple
marketplaces from [Just TCG](https://justtcg.com/)
